#Put instructions for the user - TO DO
Intro = "If youâ€™re here, you must be someone who loves to find bacteria concentrations on a budget. Who needs MATLAB anyway? Before you go on to use the website, please read the instructions carefully. Any further questions can be directed to gvahelp@gmail.com. We sincerely hope you enjoy the website. -    A couple of GVA-holes"
Instructions = "Instructions: First, upload your images (maximum of three at a time as of 2/22/24). First, set the number of crop regions to the number of pipette tips per image. Then, place the crop boxes around each pipette tip in the images that load. Finally, scroll down to below the images where the cropped pipette tips appear. Click once at the very end of the pipette tip, and once at the top of the agarose gel inside of the tip. Then, select 5-10 colonies as close to the tip as possible. Finally, press the Send to Streamlit button just below the bottom left of the image and record the results that appear."
